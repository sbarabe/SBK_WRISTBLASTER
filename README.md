## Overview

This project is for a custom-built wrist blaster prop, inspired by the *Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire* movie.

The **SBK_WRISTBLASTER_CORE** firmware is designed to control LED animations, sound effects, and mechanical features using an Arduino Nano Every.

A 3D model is provided for 3D printing parts for this project. While the SBK PCBs are designed to fit this model, they can also be used in other designs.

The provided schematics utilize the SBK PCBs for easier assembly. Due to the restricted space inside the blaster, using these PCBs ensures that all components fit neatly inside.

This project is intended for prop enthusiasts, cosplayers, and makers who want to create a realistic and interactive wrist blaster with dynamic lighting effects and customizable sound.

## Features

- üé∂ **Sound Effects:** Controlled using a DFPlayer Mini.
- üí° **LED Animations:** Custom LED bar meters, cycling lights, and pulsating effects.
- üî• **Heat Level Simulation:** LED bar that rises with the "heat level" and gradually cools down when not in use.
- üéõ **Potentiometer Control:** Adjust volume and firing strobe hue.
- üìü **MAX7219 or HT16K33 Support:** bar meter driver using MAX7219 or HT16K33 LEDs driver.
- üí® **Vacuum Pump and Fan Outputs:** Dedicated 5V outputs (0.5A max each) for controlling smoke effects, fully integrated on the PCB.
- üéÆ **Standalone Operation:** The code can run without a functional player, making debugging easier.
- üìä **Serial Debugging:** Real-time debugging through the Arduino IDE.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Arduino Nano Every** (not to be confused with the regular Nano)
- **DFPlayer Mini DFR0299 (genuine)** and an SD card
- **A fully populated custom SBK Wristblaster PCB** 
- **2x B10K Potentiometers** (for analog inputs)
- **4x Mini Blue Toggle Switches**
- **5x WS2812 Single LED Pixels**
- **2x WS2812 7-LED Jewels**
- **1x 16mm Momentary Push Button with Yellow LED Indicator** (R16-503)
- **1x 28-Segment Bar Meter** (BL28-3000-Sx04Y)
- **Proper LED Driver PCBs for the Bar Meter** (using HT16K33 or MAX72xx drivers). We recommend using the **SBK_BG_xx_DRIVER** and **SBK_BG_28SEG** PCBs with MAX7221 LED drivers.
- **6-12V Power Pack:** We suggest using a 6V NiMh flat pack that fits the battery holder 3D model in this project, but you may choose your own power source.

### SBK PCBs
- Main PCB :                                       **SBK_WRISTBLASTER_PCB_II V0**
- Driver PCB for **common cathode** bar meter :    **SBK_WB_BG_SK_DR V0**
- Driver PCB for **common anode** bar meter :      **SBK_WB_BG_SA_DR V0**
- Bar meter holder PCB for BL28-3005Sx bar meter : **SBK_WB_BG_28SEG V0**
  
  PCBs are produce in small batches and on demand, with only a small amount kept in stock.
  üíª **Inquiries for PCBs** can be sent to [SmartBuildsKits@gmail.com](mailto:SmartBuildsKits@gmail.com).

## Firmware Installation

1. **Download the files:**

- Go to the GitHub repository: [SBK_WRISTBLASTER](https://github.com/SmartBuildsKits/SBK_WRISTBLASTER)
- Click on the **Code** button and select **Download ZIP**.
- Extract the ZIP file to your computer.

2. **Move the files to the correct folders:**

- Copy the **SBK_WRISTBLASTER_CORE** folder inside your Arduino IDE **Sketches** folder.
- In that folder, you will find another folder named **SBK_WristBlaster_lib**, move it inside your Arduino IDE **Sketches\libraries** folder.

3. **Install required libraries:**

- Open Arduino IDE and use the **Library Manager** to install the following libraries along with all their dependencies:
    - **Adafruit_NeoPixel.h**
    - **DFPlayerMini_Fast.h**

4. **Upload the code:**

- From the Arduino IDE Sketches folder, open **SBK_WRISTBLASTER_CORE.ino** in Arduino IDE.
- You'll see two tabs: the **CONFIG** file and the **CORE** file.
- **Do not modify the main code file** (**SBK_WRISTBLASTER_CORE.ino**) : it is designed to remain untouched.
- Review and modify your settings in **SBK_WRISTBLASTER_CONFIG.h** according to your build.
- Connect your Arduino Nano Every to your computer using a suitable USB cable.
- Select the correct **COM port** and set **Arduino Nano Every** as your board.
- Upload the sketch.

## Sound Effects

Sound effects examples are provided for this project. They fit the tracks numbers and lengths defined in the firmware config file. Since DFPlayer play file not by name but by the order they have been written on the SD card, each sound effect should be placed one by one in the correct order on clean formated SD card root folder. Additional tracks can be placed in the "/01" folder of the SD card; these tracks will play in Party Mode.

**Disclaimer**: The sound effects in this project are derived from the *Ghostbusters* movies and video games, which are commonly available within the *Ghostbusters* community. These sounds are not owned by me, and the original works are copyrighted by their respective owners. The sound effects here have been edited, cut, and remixed for use in this project. No copyright infringement is intended. It is your responsibility to ensure that your use of these sound effects does not violate copyright laws.

## Usage

- **Power On:** Flip the main power switch.
- **Cyclotron On:** Flip the cyclotron switch, you can fire when switch is on.
- **Fire Type:** Flip Activate Switch to select between Capture or Burst Fire.
- **Fire :** Press the trigger button to initiate the firing sequence with synchronized LEDs and sound effects.
- **Overheat:** Blaster will overheat, vent and reboot after a few Burst shots or a long Capture shot. Blaster is cooling down while in idle...
- **Party Mode:** Engage in playback mode.
- **Smoke:** While in Power Off state, you can enable/disable the smoke device by pressing the Fire Button for 3 seconds. You will see the Top White indicator switching form green/red to show smoke device status : green = enabled, red = disabled.

## Schematics

The provided schematics show the wiring using the SBK custom PCBs, making the assembly easier and cleaner. Using the SBK_BG_Sx_DRIVER for the bar meter and the SBK_BG_28SEG with MAX72xx simplifies the LED matrix connection. The fan and vacuum pump are also directly powered from the PCB's dedicated 5V-500mA outputs.
