/**********************************************************************************************

 *
 *  THIS IS THE CONFIGURATION FILE.  
 *  - All your hardware and functional settings should be made here.  
 *  - The main core file (SBK_WRISTBLASTER_CORE.ino) should remain untouched.  
 *  - This approach keeps your code modular, easier to update, and cleaner to maintain.

/**********************************************************************************************
 *  
 *  THIS CONFIG FILE PARAMETERS ARE SET FOR THIS HARDWARE:
 * 
 *      MCU board -> Arduino Nano Every:    The Nano Every is a 5V board with the same pinout and
 *                                          footprint as the Nano, but with more memory and a faster MCU.
 *                                          The code is too large for a regular Nano or even the Uno, 
 *                                          it will not compile on those boards.
 * 
 *      Mains PCB -> SBK_WRISTBLASTER_II V0
 *      Bar Meter Driver -> MAX7219 or MAX7221: the latter induces less voltage noise/ripples that 
 *                                              could affect audio quality.
 *      Bar Meter Driver PCBs -> SBK_WB_BG_SK_DR V0
 *      Bar Meter Holder PCB -> SBK_WB_BG_28SEG V0
 *      Bar Meter -> BL28Z-3005SK (common cathode)
 *      Fire Button -> With a LED indicator: The LED should draw no more than 20mA, with the appropriate
 *                                           series resistor to limit forward voltage. The SBK_WRISTBLASTER_II V0
 *                                           PCB provides space for a LED resistor. For example, a yellow 20mA,
 *                                           1.8-2.0V forward voltage LED should use a 150-ohm series resistor for
 *                                           a 5V driving signal from the MCU pin.
 *      Intensify Switch/Button -> Set up for a SWITCH, but can be modified to use a PUSH BUTTON setup in the 
 *                                 SWITCHES AND BUTTONS section.
 *      Software Volume Potentiometer -> Enable: If there is no potentiometer attached to this pin, 
 *                                               the volume may vary unpredictably.
 *      Firing Strobe Hue Potentiometer -> Enable: If there is no potentiometer attached to this pin,
 *                                                 the hue may vary because the analog value of a floating pin is undetermined.
 *      Smoke Module Control -> The fan and pump can be connected to the driver pins. The smoke module should be 
 *                              activated via a vacuum or with a proper external device (relay/MOSFET) driven
 *                              by the pump signal.
 *      Sound FX Tracks (as provided in the example) -> The code is based on track lengths. If you change the tracks, you will need to adjust the track lengths in the SOUND FX TRACK LENGTHS AND LOOPING sections.
 *                                                      You should also adjust the SOME STATE/STAGE PARAMETERS section where certain lengths are defined relative to the sound FX.
 *  
 *   All of the above can be modified in this file without needing to change the main core code.
