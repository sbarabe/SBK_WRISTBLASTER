The 3D model provided is part of this project: [SBK_WRISTBLASTER](https://github.com/SmartBuildsKits/SBK_WRISTBLASTER).

The SBK PCBs are initially designed to fit this model but can also be used in other models.

The SBK PCBs are specifically designed to fit this model but can also be used in other designs.
