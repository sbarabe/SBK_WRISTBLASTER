# Sound Effects

Sound effects examples are provided for this project : [SBK_WRISTBLASTER_CORE](https://github.com/SmartBuildsKits/SBK_WRISTBLASTER_CORE). They fit the firmware track numbers and lengths defined in the config file. Each sound effect should be placed in the correct order on the Player's SD card root folder. Additional tracks can be placed in the "/01" folder of the SD card; these tracks will play in Party Mode.
